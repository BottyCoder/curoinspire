Hi there,

i need to add a feature to the billing page. To troubleshoot billing calculations. I need you to show on the billing page in its own table, the last 10 billable sessions that we stored to the db. showing details we store in the db. we only need the timestamp, mobile number, status and costs from the billing module

Hey Marc! I'll help you add a table to show the last 10 billable sessions. We'll need to modify both the backend and frontend to achieve this.

First, let's add an endpoint to fetch the session data:

billing.js
Now, let's add the table to the billing page:

public/billing.html
public/styles/main.css
This will add a new table showing the last 10 billable sessions below your existing stats. The table will include:

Timestamp
Mobile Number
Status
Utility Cost
Carrier Cost
MAU Cost
Total Cost
The table will refresh hourly along with the other stats, and includes hover states and proper formatting for the data.

You're welcome Marc! Let me know if you need any other changes or have questions about the billing interface.

the billing.html is incorrect and doesnt appear to be updating from supabase.

please debug for errors

Hey Marc! Looking at the console output, I can see the error:

Error fetching recent sessions: {
  code: '42703',
  details: null,
  hint: null,
  message: 'column billing_records.status does not exist'
}
The error indicates we're trying to query a 'status' column that doesn't exist in the billing_records table. Let's modify the query in billing.js to match the actual columns in the table:

billing.js
Fix billing records query columns
And let's update the table in billing.html to match:

public/billing.html
Update billing table columns, Update table row template
before you make any changes.

here are some records from the DB.

Firstly, it looks records have not been stored correctly since yesterday at 13:32.

please also check that its pulling the correct fields for the updating of the billing page

Hey Marc! Looking at the records from the database and the current billing page implementation, I notice a few issues:

We're trying to query a 'status' column that doesn't exist in the billing_records table
The table appears to have duplicate records with the same whatsapp_message_id and timestamps very close together (fractions of seconds apart)
The billing page needs to show the additional field whatsapp_message_id
Let's update the billing implementation to match the actual database structure:

billing.js
public/billing.html
Regarding the duplicate records - this appears to be a separate issue in the message logging logic that's creating multiple records for the same WhatsApp message. We should investigate the webhook handler to prevent these duplicates.

Hey Marc! Looking at your whatsapp-status-webhook.js and the billing records you shared, I notice two potential issues:

The webhook is only storing message statuses in messages_log table, not billing_records
We're seeing duplicate entries in billing_records for the same whatsapp_message_id
Let's add billing record creation to the webhook handler:

whatsapp-status-webhook.js
This change will:

Check if a billing record already exists for the message ID
Only create a new billing record if one doesn't exist
Use consistent timestamp formatting
Set proper cost values and MAU status

we need to look at where billing is inserted as from what i can see, no billing is being inserted. No edits until we identify the issue.

Please go through the billing.js to look for format or structural issues. also check the logs for any auth issues

Hey Marc, let me analyze the billing flow.

Looking at the code, I notice that billing records are supposed to be inserted in the whatsapp-status-webhook.js file. The issue appears to be in the webhook handler where billing records are being created.

From the logs I can see the webhook is receiving requests successfully, but let's look at potential issues:

The billing insert is happening in whatsapp-status-webhook.js but only AFTER checking for existing records:
// First check if billing record already exists for this message
const { data: existingBilling } = await supabase
  .from("billing_records")
  .select("id")
  .eq("whatsapp_message_id", messageId)
  .single();
if (!existingBilling) {
  const billingRecord = {
    whatsapp_message_id: messageId,
    mobile_number: recipientId,
    message_timestamp: messageTime.toISOString(),
    // ...
  };
Looking at your logs and the database sample you shared, I notice:

The webhook is receiving messages (logs show incoming requests)
The billing_records table structure matches the insert attempt
No apparent auth issues in the logs
The key issue appears to be that the webhook may be finding existing records when checking whatsapp_message_id, causing it to skip the insert. This would explain why no new billing records are being created.

Before making any changes, I recommend we:

Add debug logging around the billing check/insert to confirm if records are being skipped
Verify the messageId format matches between webhook and database
Check if all required billing_records table columns are included in the insert
Would you like me to propose adding some debug logging to help identify exactly where the billing insert is failing?

lets first confirm the logic of what should happen.

Lets go back to the 23 hour 50 minute session window.

Can you please let me know how we are managing this and what your understanding of the billing logic is for this

MS

Hey Marc! Looking at the billing logic in the codebase, let me break down how the 23h50m session window is currently being handled:

In billing.js, the session window logic is implemented here:

const timeDiff = messages[i].timestamp.diff(currentSession[0].timestamp, 'minutes');
if (timeDiff <= 1430) { // 23 hours and 50 minutes
    currentSession.push(messages[i]);
} else {
    activeSessions.push(currentSession);
    currentSession = [messages[i]];
}
The current billing logic works like this:

For each user (mobile number), messages are grouped into sessions

A new session starts when:

It's the first message from that user in the current period
Or when a message is more than 23h50m (1430 minutes) from the first message in the current session
For each session:

Carrier fee: $0.01 once per session
Utility fee: $0.0076 once per session
Total session cost: $0.0176
MAU (Monthly Active User):

$0.06 charged once per unique user per month
This is independent of session count
Looking at your database records from earlier, I notice the cost_carrier and cost_utility are being stored per message rather than per session. This could lead to overcharging since we're not properly grouping messages into sessions.

Would you like me to propose changes to fix this and ensure we're only charging once per 23h50m session window?

the logic is correct. Yes, please propose the changes to me but dont make any edits

MS

Hey Marc! Based on our discussion about the 23h50m session window billing logic, here's what I recommend we change without making edits yet:

In whatsapp-status-webhook.js:
Remove the direct billing record insertion since it's creating individual records per message
Add session tracking logic instead
Collect messages for each user and check timing against session window
Create a new sessionManager.js utility to handle:
Session window tracking (23h50m)
Billing aggregation per session
MAU tracking per month
Modify billing.js to:
Use the session manager for calculations
Only create one billing record per session instead of per message
Properly track carrier fee ($0.01) and utility fee ($0.0076) once per session
Handle MAU charges ($0.06) separately on a monthly basis
The key changes would ensure:

One billing record per session (23h50m window) instead of per message
Correct cost allocation:
Session costs: $0.0176 total per session ($0.01 carrier + $0.0076 utility)
MAU: $0.06 once per unique user per month
Would you like me to propose the specific code changes for these components?

lets go ahead

Hey Marc! I'll implement the changes to fix the billing record creation and session window logic. Here's what we'll do:

Modify whatsapp-status-webhook.js to properly handle session windows
Update the billing records creation to work with sessions
whatsapp-status-webhook.js
This change:

Properly implements the 23h50m session window
Only creates new billing records for new sessions
Adds MAU charge only on first session of each month
Includes better logging for debugging

Hey Marc! Looking at the console logs, I can see that the billing page is loading but there might be an issue with the data fetching. Let me check the relevant parts.

In billing.js, I notice we need to adjust the stats route to properly handle timezone and message timings. Here's the fix:

billing.js
This should help us see what's happening with the data fetching. Can you check the logs again after these changes to see if we get more detailed error information?

just now
Hey Marc! Let's test the billing functionality. We can simulate messages and check if billing records are being created correctly. Here's how:

First, let's send a test message using the client-send-message endpoint:
test-billing.js
Create test script for billing
Run the test:
node test-billing.js
Check the billing dashboard at /billing.html to verify the records were created.
